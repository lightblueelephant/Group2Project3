# Parking Citation Calculator

We've been contacted by a local parking management company who's interested in trying to figure out if their tickets paid vs unpaid ratio is affected by the rates they're charging for violations. The aim of this program is to use historical data from several years of parking violations to see if they might be able to get better compliance with ticket pay offs if they were to charge more or less per violation in certain parking zones. The program will display interactive visual charts and graphs showing the ratio of compliance in real time and the parking attendant can reference the data as they are issuing tickets to determine what the appropriate rate should be for any given parking zone.

## Technologies

This application is compatible with Python 3.9. The program is a Jupyter Notebook file and is best run in either a Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook IDE.
The Pandas, Numpy, datetime, pathlib libraries were used along with hvplot and must be installed in order to run the program correctly.


Pandas is used for data science and analysis and machine learning.

Numpy is used to provide scientific computing support to Python.

Pathlib is used point Python to file paths.

HvPlot allows for the creation of interactive graphs and plots of data.

datetime allows Python to manipulate dates and tiems.


This program will work on Windows, MacOS and Linux with Python 3.9 installed. The program is a Juypter notebook file and will run best in Juypter Lab.

Documentation for the Pandas library can be found [here.](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)

Documentation for the Numpy library can be found [here.](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)

Documentation for the pathlib library can be found[here.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
